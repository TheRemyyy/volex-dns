## Overview

Volex DNS is a lightweight, concurrent DNS forwarder written in Go. It connects to multiple upstream DNS-over-TLS (DoT) providers simultaneously and returns the fastest response, ensuring your browsing experience is always snappy and secure.

### Key Features

- **⚡ Race Mode** — Queries multiple upstreams (Cloudflare, Google, Quad9) in parallel; first response wins.
- **🔒 Secure** — All upstream connections use DNS over TLS (DoT) on port 853.
- **🧠 Smart Caching** — In-memory caching with configurable TTLs to reduce latency for frequent queries.
- **🛠️ Self-Service** — Responds to local PTR requests for instant identifying.
- **🚀 Efficiency** — Optimized for low memory and CPU usage.
